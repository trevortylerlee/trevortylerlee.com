# trevortylerlee.com

Hi and welcome to my diary! Built with Astro (and a sprinkle of React). For this website I wanted to a. stick to vanilla CSS and b. minimize its dependencies. It uses some new features in Astro 2.0 like content collections, schema validation, and type-safe Markdown.

## Technologies Used

- Astro
- TypeScript
- [react-hot-toast]()
- Vercel

## Setup Instructions

```zsh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/boogerbuttcheeks/astro.git foo

# Navigate to the directory
cd foo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run on localhost:3000
npm run dev
```
