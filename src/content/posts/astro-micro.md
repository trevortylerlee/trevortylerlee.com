Astro Micro is a new blog template for Astro. It's a fork of [Mark Horn's](https://github.com/markhorn-dev) popular [Astro Nano](https://astro-nano-demo.vercel.app/) template. Like Astro Nano, there's zero frameworks by default. It's live on the [Astro Themes](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-micro/) page and you can see it in action [here](https://astro-micro.vercel.app/).

## Features

- Everything in Astro Nano plus...
- Search with Pagefind
- Comments with Giscus
- Table of contents
- Pagination
- Callout components
- and [more](https://astro-micro.vercel.app/blog/00-micro-changelog)!

It's great to see people forking and starring Astro Nano! The repo is [here](https://github.com/trevortylerlee/astro-micro) and setup instructions are [here](https://astro-micro.vercel.app/blog/01-getting-started).

If you encounter any bugs please open an issue on the repo. Big thank you to [all contributers](https://astro-micro.vercel.app/blog/00-micro-changelog#issues-%EF%B8%8F) for their help!
