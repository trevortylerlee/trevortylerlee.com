The site now uses TailwindCSS, and has new components from [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [Radix](https://radix-ui.com).  There's a Command Bar component in the top right which contains quick links and actions. It can be toggled with the keyboard shortcut Command + K on Mac and Ctrl + K on Windows.

## CSS Modules to TailwindCSS

I switched to Tailwind because I wanted to use their [just-in-time compiler](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/just-in-time-the-next-generation-of-tailwind-css), which optimizes your CSS and reduces their file size. 

I ran some lighthouse tests and interestingly TailwindCSS loads ~80% more bytes in ~30% less time... not sure if that's right but it did bump my performance score from 98 to 100 ðŸ˜Ž

## Astro Import Bug

There were some problems with Astro importing some third-party modules. The solution was in [this Github issue](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/3174). Long story short there's a workaround by editing the astro config file.

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  vite: {
    ssr: {
      noExternal: ["modules"],
    },
  },
});
```
