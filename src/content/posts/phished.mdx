Teamed up with six other developers and designers to create Phished, a
web application to send (harmless!) phishing emails and track the
results. [Click to check it out!](https://phished.up.railway.app/)

## Why build Phished?

Our goal for this project was to encourage users to take a proactive
role in the fight against phishing emails. We found that elderly
individuals are disproportionally targeted and impacted by online
scams, many of which originate from fraudulent emails.

We also realized that those same elderly users were unlikely to be the
ones using Phished, so our focus was on giving Internet-savvy a tool
to educate their loved ones in an interactive and positive manner.
