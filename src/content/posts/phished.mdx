I led a team of seven developers and designers to build Phished, a fun
and interactive way to educate users about phishing.

## Why build Phished?

Our goal for this project was to encourage users to take an active
role in the fight against phishing emails. We found that elderly
individuals are disproportionally targeted and impacted by online
scams, many of which originate from fraudulent emails.

<br />

We also realized that those same elderly users were unlikely to be the
ones using Phished, so our focus was on giving Internet-savvy a tool
to educate their loved ones in an interactive and positive manner.

<br />

## How does it work?

Users create campaigns, where personalized phishing emails are sent to
a target. If the target clicks on the link in the email, we record the
event and display the results in a dashboard. Over a period of time,
users can see which of their targets clicked on the link and how many
of them fell for a scam.

<br />

When targets fall for a phishing email sent by us, we redirect them to
our page where they can learn about the scam and how to avoid it in
the future. Our goal is for users to evaluate the results from their
campaigns and see improvement from their targets over time. We hope
that users will share their results with their loved ones to encourage
them to be more vigilant.

<br />

## What did I do?

I was the lead developer on this project, and I was responsible for
implementing our design system, building the dashboard, and
integrating the front-end application with data from our back-end. I worked closely with our designers to
ensure that our design system was consistent and easy to use. We used
Mantine, a React UI library, to build out our front-end.

<br />

I also worked closely with our back-end developers to build out the
site's infrastructure. We used Firebase's Firestore database to store
user data and NextAuth to handle user authentication and
authorization. I designed our phishing emails using Handlebars.js, an
HTML templating language. We used Nodemailer to send the emails with a
hash, so when targets click the link, we can track which user sent the
email. Finally, we displayed the results on the user dashboard using
Chart.js.

<br />

## What did I learn?

I learned a lot about building a full-stack application from scratch.
I developed my technical skills by working with unfamiliar tools like
Nodemailer and NextAuth, and I'm confident that I can learn new
note quickly. I also learned a lot about the importance of
collaboration and how to work with others in a team setting. I'm
really proud of the work that we did on this project. 🎣
