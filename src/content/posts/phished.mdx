I led a team of seven to create Phished, a web application to send (harmless!) phishing emails and track the results. [Click to check it out!](https://phished.up.railway.app/)

## Why build Phished?

Our goal for this project was to encourage users to take a proactive role in the fight against phishing emails. We found that elderly individuals are disproportionally targeted and impacted by online scams, many of which originate from fraudulent emails.

We also realized that those same elderly users were unlikely to be the ones using Phished, so our focus was on giving Internet-savvy a tool to educate their loved ones in an interactive and positive manner. The best way to learn is to do, which means that in order to get better at avoiding phishing emails we need to expose them to real-world examples.
