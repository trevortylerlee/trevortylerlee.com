### [Beta React Docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/)

I started learning React with the beta docs. The biggest change in the
beta docs is that they’ve rewritten everything to use hooks instead of
classes. I don’t think I have ever used classes in React – not sure if
that’s good or not…

<br />

### [Operator Lookup](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/operator-lookup/)

Just bookmark this!

<br />

### [Can I Use…](https://caniuse.com/)

Imo one of the worst things about web development is ensuring your
website works on different browsers. Can I Use is great because if a
feature isn’t like 98% supported yet I can just forget about it for
the next couple years.

<br />

### [WebAIM: Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

Does what it says and you can check your dark mode _and_ your light
mode on the same screen.

<br />

### [SmolCSS](https://smolcss.dev/)

> “Minimal snippets for modern CSS layouts and components” - SmolCSS

Yup

### [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/)

It’s like any other well-designed icon set except the accessibility
icon has a wheelchair person in action, so much cooler.
