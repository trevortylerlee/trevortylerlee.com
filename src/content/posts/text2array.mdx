[I made a tool to type arrays quickly.](https://text2array.vercel.app/)

You type the elements you want inside the array and the tool formats
them to be copy pasted. There are options for quotations, commas, or
spaces.

I've implemented a "quick fill" feature which fills the input box with
some common lists, like the English alphabet and the days of the week.

I'm planning to keep adding additional quick fill options.
