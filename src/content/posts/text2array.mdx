[I made a tool to type arrays quickly.](https://text2array.vercel.app/)

<br />

You type the elements you want inside the array and the tool formats
them to be copy pasted. There are options for quotations, commas, or
spaces.

<br />

There's a "quick fill" feature which fills the input box with some
common lists, like the English alphabet and the months of the year.

<br />

## Spaghetti, spaghetti everywhere

Hopefully this is the worst code I'll ever write.

<br />

```jsx
<textarea
  placeholder={
    noSpace
      ? perCharacter
        ? `${quote}o${quote},${quote}n${quote},${quote}e${quote},${quote}t,${quote},${quote}w${quote},${quote}o${quote},${quote}t${quote},${quote}h${quote},${quote}r${quote},${quote}e${quote},${quote}e${quote}`
        : lineBreak
        ? `${quote}one two three${quote},${quote}four five six${quote}`
        : `${quote}one${quote},${quote}two${quote},${quote}three${quote}`
      : perCharacter
      ? `${quote}o${quote}, ${quote}n${quote}, ${quote}e${quote}, ${quote}t, ${quote}, ${quote}w${quote}, ${quote}o${quote}, ${quote}t${quote}, ${quote}h${quote}, ${quote}r${quote}, ${quote}e${quote}, ${quote}e${quote}`
      : lineBreak
      ? `${quote}one two three${quote}, ${quote}four five six${quote}`
      : `${quote}one${quote}, ${quote}two${quote}, ${quote}three${quote}`
  }
  value={output}
  readOnly
/>
```

<br />

This code is for the output preview of the placeholder text. There are
multiple options to format the output which made it a challenge to
cover all the cases. You can:

<br />

1. Choose between single or double quotes
2. Choose between spaces or no spaces
3. Split by line breaks
4. Split by character

<br />

Some options aren't compatible with one another, so I had to make sure
the options, placeholder text, and output preview were reflected
accurately.

<br />

## Final Thoughts

As the application grew and I tried to provide more formatting
options, things grew increasingly complex. If I were to do this again,
I would try using React's <code>useReducer</code> hook to simplify the
state of the formatting options.

<br />

I actually used this tool for some of my other projects, like a
[guessing game based on Taylor Swift's discography](https://tsguess.vercel.app).
