Here are two websites I've been working on.

### [swiftie.red](https://swiftie.red)

Swifties, rejoice! [Swiftie.red](https://swiftie.red) is the best place to play games, earn points, and unlock collectibles all about Taylor Swift!

### [thirtysixquestions.org](https://thirtysixquestions.org)

Based on a 1997 study, [thirtysixquestions.org](https://thirtysixquestions.org) contains three sets of twelve questions — each one designed to progressively deepen the relationship between participants.

This activity comes from the idea that _mutual vulnerability fosters closeness_. While mostly intended to be an activity for romantic partners, feel free
to do it with friends, but be warned — you might fall in love!
