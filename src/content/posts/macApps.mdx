## New File Menu – Paid ($1.99)

One quirk that especially annoys me is the inability to quickly create a file in Finder. If I want to create a .txt file in the directory I’m in, I have to open Terminal. I’m sure this method works for some folks, but as someone not very good with Terminal this process gets annoying FAST!

<br />

[New File Menu by Coral Wu](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/new-file-menu/id1064959555?mt=12) allows you to right-click in any directory and create a new file. That’s literally it. Good way to spend $2.

<br />

## Tot – Free

[Tot is an awesome little app made by iconfactory](https://tot.rocks/) that sits in your menu bar. It has seven buttons at the top, each being their own little scratchpad. While there are other ways of quickly capturing notes (there’s Quick Note built into macOS) I find Tot to be satisfyingly limited in features.

<br />

I like to think of it as a Stickies replacement, except I don’t have to literally place some stupid Post-It note on my desktop to use it.

<br />

## Rectangle – Free (with an optional paid version)

[Rectangle is a free, open-source app by Ryan Hanson](https://rectangleapp.com/) and I couldn’t imagine life without it. While there are many shortcuts and tons of customizability, I really only use it to put one window on the left and one on the right.

<br />

Power users can find even more use out of Rectangle with Rectangle Pro, which has quicker window snapping, customizable templates, and more. Personally, I find the free version covers all my use cases, but if you end up enjoying Rectangle and can afford it the Pro version is $15.
