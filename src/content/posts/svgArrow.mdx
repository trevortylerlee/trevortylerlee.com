If you go to my home page and play around with the window size you'll notice that my post about Phished has some weird behaviour from 500px to 460px. Setting the window size to 461px and hovering over the card makes my SVG arrow flow off the page.

![SVG Arrow overflowing the page](/svgArrow/overflow.jpg)

<figcaption class="-mt-8">
  From 500px to 460px the SVG arrow threatens to overflow the page
</figcaption>

I have some CSS in my code that causes this.

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 500px) and (min-width: 460px) {
  .title {
    white-space: nowrap;
  }
}
```

Because I'm passing my title in dynamically, I can't put the last word in the title and the SVG arrow together so the arrow doesn't break off onto a new line by itself.

<figcaption class="-mt-8">The SVG arrow breaks to a new line</figcaption>

I think I can do this in JavaScript by spliting the title into an array and separating the last word from the others. Then I could put the last word and the SVG arrow together. Problem is I'm using Astro and it's an Astro component, so adding JavaScript just feelsbad.

Which option do you think is better? I'm leaning towards letting the arrow break onto the new line for 40px of screen width. If you have a solution to this problem, hit me up.
