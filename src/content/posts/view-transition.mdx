<Note type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Currently, the View Transition API only works in Chrome Canary.
</Note>

### 1. Enable the following feature flags in Chrome Canary

```
chrome://flags#view-transition
chrome://flags#view-transition-on-navigation
```

### 2. First line of code

Copy and paste this meta tag into your `<head>`.

```html
<meta name="view-transition" content="same-origin" />
```

### 3. Second line of code

Decide on the element you want to transition from on `page1.html`. In this example, I'm using the page container `<div>`.

```html
<!-- page1.html -->

<div style="view-transition-name: foo">
  <!-- page content -->
</div>
```

### 4. Third line of code

Decide on the element you want to transition to on `page2.html`. In this example, I'm using the page container `<div>` for `page2.html`.

```html
<!-- page2.html -->

<div style="view-transition-name: foo">
  <!-- page content -->
</div>
```

Done! Now when you navigate from `page1.html` to `page2.html` (and vice versa), the browser will animate the transition between the two pages.
