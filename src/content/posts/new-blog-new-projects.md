I've got a new blog at [boogerbuttcheeks.com](https://boogerbuttcheeks.com/). Most new content will be posted over there and not here, although I'll continue to update this site. [boogerbuttcheeks.com](https://boogerbuttcheeks.com/) is built on [Barebones](https://barebones.superwebthemes.com/) which is a part of my new project, [SuperWeb Themes](https://superwebthemes.com/).

I built [SuperWeb Themes](https://superwebthemes.com/) and open sourced the [Barebones template](https://github.com/superwebthemes/barebones) because I grew frustrated building out blogs with Astro. The templates and themes on the [Astro website](https://astro.build/themes/) are often outdated, unmaintained, and missing features I consider essential for a blog (OpenGraph support is almost never implemented correctly). I devoted my effort to ensuring Barebones offers the bare minimum needed for a modern day blog while using best practices based on the official [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

That means built-in light and dark mode (using the new and widely supported [light-dark() syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/light-dark)), RSS feeds, custom OpenGraph images on individual posts with fallbacks, and more. There's one integration included, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and *zero frameworks installed*.

The end result is an optimized, lightweight Astro + Tailwind CSS that's infinitely customizable. If you're looking to get started, check out the [documentation](https://docs.superwebthemes.com/). I've also been building more themes on top of Barebones â€” they're available with pay what you can pricing on [Gumroad](https://superwebthemes.gumroad.com/).

My hope is this will lower the barrier of entry to starting your own blog while maintaining ownership of your code. In my opinion, the best part about these templates is you can forget about the boring stuff like styling and metadata and [just start writing](https://boogerbuttcheeks.com/blog/3-upload-more-download-less/).
