### [Tap 1 to 20 as fast as you can](https://1to20.vercel.app/)

Saw this game on TikTok and tried to recreate it. The TikTok one had the numbers appear faster over time, which I struggled with implementing.

### [Guess the Taylor Swift song](https://tsguess.vercel.app/)

I found a JSON file with all of Taylor Swift's songs and their lyrics. I cleaned up the data and made a guessing game out of it.

I used Prisma to interact with a Postgres database on Railway. I learned it's important to disable a form after submission to prevent duplicate submissions.
