In this game users are prompted to guess the color when given an HTML color name. The most challenging part of this project was developing the scoring system â€“ I decided to base it around the difference between the user's color and the actual value of the HTML color name using their RGB values.

Calculating the color difference to create a reliable scoring system was much harder than I anticipated. Due to the way the human eyeball works, RGB values don't always correlate to how we perceive color.

_Mathematically_ the scoring system works, but to the human eye it's _perceptually_ wrong. Obviously, this has led to many complaints.
