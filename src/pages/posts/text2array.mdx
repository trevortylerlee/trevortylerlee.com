Typing out arrays is a chore, so [I made a tool to speed up the process.](https://text2array.vercel.app/)

You type the elements you want inside the array and the tool will format them to be copy pasted into your array. There are options for quotations, commas, or spaces.

I've implemented a "quick fill" feature which fills the input box with some common lists, like the English alphabet and the days of the week.

I'm planning to keep adding additional quick fill options.
