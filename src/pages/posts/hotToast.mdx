import { Code } from "astro/components";

Struggling to get [react-hot-toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/) working on your Astro site? I did, too – thankfully, @happydev on the Astro discord was able to figure it out.

To get react-hot-toast working, **it needs to be in the same Astro island as the component that is triggering the toast.** An Astro island is an interactive UI component on an otherwise static HTML page. Astro islands exist because Astro, by default, generates websites with zero client-side JavaScript. Sometimes we need a little JavaScript for some interactivity on our site – that's what Astro islands are for.

<br />

### 1. Install react-hot-toast

```
npm install react-hot-toast
```

<br />

### 2. Create a React component to trigger the toast

We'll use a button to trigger our toast notification.

```jsx
export default function Button() {
  return <button>Toast!</button>;
}
```

<br />

### 3. Create a toast component

We're going to make a Toast component that we can then import into our React component. In a new file (I called mine `Toastify.tsx`), import `Toaster` from react-hot-toast and customize it however you want.

```jsx
import { Toaster } from "react-hot-toast";

export default (Component) => {
  return (props) => (
    <>
      <Toaster
        position="top-center"
        reverseOrder={false}
        gutter={8}
        containerClassName=""
        containerStyle={{}}
        toastOptions={{
          // Define default options
          className: "",
          duration: 5000,
          style: {
            background: "#363636",
            color: "#fff",
          },

          // Default options for specific types
          success: {
            duration: 3000,
            style: {
              color: "black",
              background: "white",
              border: "3px solid black",
            },
          },
        }}
      />
      <Component {...props} />
    </>
  );
};
```

<br />

### 4. Import the toast component into the React component

We're going to wrap the button component that we made in our new `<Toastify />` component. Let's also setup a function called `notify` that will trigger a toast when our button is clicked.

```jsx
import Toastify from "./Toastify";
import toast from "react-hot-toast";
```
